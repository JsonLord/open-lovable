# Project Documentation

## 1. Project Scope Estimation (1-10)
**Estimated Scope: [Insert number 1-10]**
**Core Components:**
- [Component 1]
- [Component 2]
- [Component 3]

## 2. Project Description

### Vision
[Describe the overall vision and purpose of the project]

### Concrete Goals
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]
- [Goal 3]

### Future Use Cases
[Describe potential future applications of the project]

### Future Integrations
[Mention other projects/applications this could integrate with]

## 3. External Project/API Integrations
[List of external projects or API endpoints to be integrated]
- [Project/API 1]
- [Project/API 2]

## 4. Component Architecture

### 4.1 Component List
[List all components that need to be built]
- [Component 1]
- [Component 2]

### 4.2 Component Details
For each component, describe:
- Architecture protocol (security, functionality)
- Interaction endpoints
- Integration method (clone full, partial, or mirror functionality)
- Build protocol

### 4.3 Test Cases per Component
Describe functionality tests without writing code:
- [Test 1: Functionality to test, success criteria]
- [Test 2: Functionality to test, success criteria]

## 5. Full Pipeline Test
**Description:**
[Describe the full input-to-output test process]

**Success Criteria:**
[Define what constitutes a successful test]

**Mock Input Data:**
```json
[Example input data for testing]
```

## 6. API Endpoints
[List all API endpoints to be created]
- [Endpoint 1: /path, method, description]
- [Endpoint 2: /path, method, description]

**Deployment Parameters:**
[Parameters for Hugging Face deployment]
- [Parameter 1]
- [Parameter 2]

**Reference:**
See `/deployment/huggingface_interactions.md` for deployment details

## 7. Monitoring and Deployment
**Build Logs:**
```bash
curl -N \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN" \
     "https://huggingface.co/api/spaces/{$profile}/{$space_name}/logs/build"
```

**Run Logs:**
```bash
curl -N \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN" \
     "https://huggingface.co/api/spaces/{$profile}/{$space_name}/logs/run"
```

**Process:**
1. Check build logs
2. Check run logs
3. Edit files based on errors
4. Redeploy as needed
5. Test functionality via API
6. Verify output in `/deployment/functionality_endpoints_logs.txt`

**Functionality Testing:**
[Describe how to verify each endpoint is working]
- [Test method for Endpoint 1]
- [Test method for Endpoint 2]
```

To implement this template:
1. Fill in the placeholders with your specific project details
2. For the scope estimation, consider complexity of components and integrations
3. For each component, clearly define its responsibilities and interactions
4. Specify concrete test cases with measurable success criteria
5. Define all API endpoints needed for the project
6. Document the deployment parameters for Hugging Face
